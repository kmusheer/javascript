# Country Data Search and Pagination

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for countries and display their data. The application supports both input search functionality and datalist input search functionality, fetching data from a local JSON file, and pagination functionality.

## Features

### Input Search Functionality

- Users can enter a search query in the input field to filter countries by name.
- The search is case-insensitive and updates the results dynamically as the user types.

### Datalist Input Search Functionality

- Users can also select a country from a datalist for search, providing a dropdown-like experience.
- The datalist is dynamically populated with country names as the user types.

### Fetching Data from Local JSON

- The application fetches country data from a local JSON file (`test4.json`).
- Upon fetching, the data is stored locally for filtering and pagination.

### Pagination Functionality

- Countries are displayed in pages, with a fixed number of countries per page.
- Users can navigate between pages using pagination links.
- Pagination dynamically updates based on the filtered search results.
